This is a [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) project bootstrapped with [`create-expo-app`]

## 💡 Initial Idea

The initial idea for this project was to have fun with the Google Speech to Text API. 
So what this app basically does is create lists of anything (grocery store, tasks, etc) through voice command.

## ⚙️ Basic configuration

Its necessary basically to create a credential for authenticate in Google Speech to Text API(https://console.cloud.google.com/) and to set that key on .env file.

## 🧪 Technologies

This project was developed using the following technologies:

- React Native
- Typescript
- Expo
- Google Speech To Text API

## 🖥 Preview

In the example below I pressed and held the microphone button and said: "one and two and three and four", then I checked that my list was correct and clicked the save button. That was it.
